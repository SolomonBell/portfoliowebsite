          I am majoring in Computer Science and Engineering and Mathematical Economics
          with a GPA of 3.69. I am proficient in C, RISC-V Assembly, Python, R, and Java,
          and completed coursework in Linear Algebra, Discrete Structures, and statistics.
          I am comfortable using tools such as GitHub, IntelliJ, and VS Code,
          and I have experience collaborating with teams and using the Scrum framework
          to develop software.

          I am accustomed to working through complex problems under sustained pressure,
          a skill reinforced by years of structured rowing training, where progress depends
          on iteration, quick learning, and adaptation. I am a high-performance athlete
          with the aspiration to compete at the international level, and I have completed
          over 15 million meters on the indoor rower.
